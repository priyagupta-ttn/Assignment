##### Question 2: Create one sling model and display the values.Show usecase and describe these annotations @Inject, 
###### @PostConstruct, @OsgiService, @ScriptVariable, @Optional/@Required.

### @Inject:- Inject annotation is used to inject properties from resource. e.g.

~~~~~~
@Inject
@Via("resource")
@Default(values = "AEM")
String fname;
~~~~~~
#### @PostConstruct:- Post Construct is used to execute a block of code in after all dependencies injection. So, it is used when required to perform any operation after property injection.

@PostConstruct
~~~~
protected void init() {
message = "Initialising from Bootcamp PostConstruct.";
}
~~~~
##### @OsgiService:- OSGiService is used to inject any service into a model.

~~~~
@OSGiService(filter = "(component.name=serviceDemoImpl)")
private MySimpleService mySimpleService;
~~~~
#### @ScriptVariable:- ScriptVariable is used to inject any object is available in HTL.

~~~~
@ScriptVariable
Page currentPage;
~~~~
@Optional/@Required:- @Optional is used with @Inject to ensure that if the property does not exist, the model will not break that will ignore the property injection. And for @Required is used to ensure that we should have that particular property.

~~~~
@Inject
@Via("resource")
@Required
private String requiredTest;
~~~~


~~~~
@Inject
@Via("resource")
@Optional
private String optionalTest;
~~~~
